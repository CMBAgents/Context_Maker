      "## The `ndmap` object\n",
      "\n",
      "The `pixell` library supports manipulation of sky maps that are represented as\n",
      "2-dimensional grids of rectangular pixels. The supported projection and\n",
      "pixelization schemes are a subset of the schemes supported by FITS\n",
      "conventions. In addition, we provide support for a\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "plain’ coordinate system, corresponding to a Cartesian plane with identically\n",
      "shaped pixels (useful for true flat-sky calculations).\n",
      "\n",
      "In `pixell`, a map is encapsulated in an `ndmap`, which combines two objects:\n",
      "a numpy array (of at least two dimensions) whose two trailing dimensions\n",
      "correspond to two coordinate axes of the map, and a `wcs` object that\n",
      "specifies the World Coordinate System. The `wcs` component is an instance of\n",
      "Astropy’s `astropy.wcs.wcs.WCS` class. The combination of the `wcs` and the\n",
      "`shape` of the numpy array completely specifies the footprint of a map of the\n",
      "sky, and is called the `geometry`. This library helps with manipulation of\n",
      "`ndmap` objects in ways that are aware of and preserve the validity of the wcs\n",
      "information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### `ndmap` as an extension of `numpy.ndarray`\n",
      "\n",
      "The `ndmap` class extends the `numpy.ndarray` class, and thus has all of the\n",
      "usual attributes (`.shape`, `.dtype`, etc.) of an `ndarray`. It is likely that\n",
      "an `ndmap` object can be used in any functions that usually operate on an\n",
      "`ndarray`; this includes the usual numpy array arithmetic, slicing,\n",
      "broadcasting, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "\n",
      "> > > from pixell import enmap\n",
      ">>>\n",
      "\n",
      ">>> # ... code that resulted in an ndmap called imap\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>\n",
      "\n",
      ">>> print(imap.shape, imap.wcs) (100, 100)\n",
      ":{cdelt:[1,1],crval:[0,0],crpix:[0,0]} imap_extract = imap[:50,:50] # A view\n",
      "of one corner of the map. imap_extract *= 1e6 # Re-calibrate. (Also affects\n",
      "imap!) ```\n",
      "\n",
      "An `ndmap` must have at least two dimensions. The two right-most axes\n",
      "represent celestial coordinates (typically Declination and Right Ascension).\n",
      "Maps can have arbitrary number of leading dimensions, but many of the `pixell`\n",
      "CMB-related tools interpret 3D arrays with shape `(ncomp,Ny,Nx)` as\n",
      "representing `Ny` x `Nx` maps of intensity, polarization Q and U Stokes\n",
      "parameters, in that order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that `wcs` information is correctly adjusted when the array is sliced;\n",
      "for example the object returned by `imap[:50,:50]` is a view into the `imap`\n",
      "data attached to a new `wcs` object that correctly describes the footprint of\n",
      "the extracted pixels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from all the numpy functionality, `ndmap` comes with a host of\n",
      "additional attributes and functions that utilize the WCS information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### `ndmap.wcs`\n",
      "\n",
      "The `wcs` information describes the correspondence between celestial\n",
      "coordinates (typically the Right Ascension and Declination in the Equatorial\n",
      "system) and the pixel indices in the two right-most axes. In some projections,\n",
      "such as CEA or CAR, rows (and columns) of the pixel grid will often follow\n",
      "lines of constant Declination (and Right Ascension). In other projections,\n",
      "this will not be the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WCS system is very flexible in how celestial coordinates may be associated\n",
      "with the pixel array. By observing certain conventions, we can make life\n",
      "easier for users of our maps. We recommend the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The first pixel, index [0,0], should be the one that you would normally display (on a monitor or printed figure) in the lower left-hand corner of the image. The pixel indexed by [0,1] should appear to the right of [0,0], and pixel [1,0] should be above pixel [0,0]. (This recommendation originates in FITS standards documentation.)\n",
      "  * When working with large maps that are not near the celestial poles, Right Ascension should be roughly horizontal and Declination should be roughly vertical. (It should go without saying that you should also present information “as it would appear on the sky”, i.e. with Right Ascension increasing to the left!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The examples in the rest of this document are designed to respect these two\n",
      "conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "TODO: I’ve listed below common operations that would be useful to demonstrate\n",
      "here. Finish this! (See [2 Reference](reference.md#referencepage) for a dump\n",
      "of all member functions)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Creating an `ndmap`\n",
      "\n",
      "To create an empty `ndmap`, call the `enmap.zeros` or `enmap.empty` functions\n",
      "and specify the map shape as well as the pixelization information (the WCS).\n",
      "Here is a basic example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "\n",
      "> > > from pixell import enmap, utils box = np.array([[-5,10],[5,-10]]) *\n",
      "> utils.degree shape,wcs = enmap.geometry(pos=box,res=0.5 *\n",
      "> utils.arcmin,proj='car') imap = enmap.zeros((3,) + shape, wcs=wcs) ```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example we are requesting a pixelization that spans from -5 to +5 in\n",
      "declination, and +10 to -10 in Right Ascension. Note that we need to specify\n",
      "the Right Ascension coordinates in decreasing order, or the map, when we\n",
      "display it with pixel [0,0] in the lower left-hand corner, will not have the\n",
      "usual astronomical orientation.\n",

      "return an `ndmap` when an `ndmap` is passed to it in lieu of a numpy array. In\n",
      "those situations where the WCS information is removed, one can always add it\n",

      "\n",
      "Above, we learn that the map is represented in the `CAR` projection system and\n",
      "what the WCS attributes are.\n",

      "## Selecting regions of the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "If you know the pixel coordinates of the sub-region you would like to select,\n",

      "\n",
      "However, if you only know the physical coordinate bounding box in radians, you\n",
      "can use the `submap` function.\n",

      "want to convert, with the first row containing declination and the second row\n",
      "containing right ascension. Also, the returned pixel coordinates are in\n",
      "general fractional.\n",

      "original map (unless a real transform function is used). To facilitate 2DFTs,\n",
      "there are functions that do the Fourier transforms themselves, and functions\n",
      "that provide metadata associated with such transforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since an ndmap contains information about the physical extent of the map and\n",
      "the physical width of the pixels, the discrete frequencies corresponding to\n",
      "its numpy array need to be converted to physical wavenumbers of the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is done by the `laxes` function, which returns the wavenumbers along the\n",
      "Y and X directions. The `lmap` function returns a map of all the `(ly,lx)`\n",
      "wavenumbers in each pixel of the Fourier-space map. The `modlmap` function\n",
      "returns the “modulus of lmap”, i.e. a map of the distances of each Fourier-\n",
      "pixel from `(ly=0,lx=0)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can perform a fast Fourier transform of an (…,Ny,Nx) dimensional ndmap to\n",
